Brief explanation of the Js code design by Ebesoh Adrian 

for The random Generating color projects in a frame

Code Breakdown:
Selecting the Container Element:


const container = document.getElementById('container')
Retrieves an HTML element with the ID 'container', which is expected to be a <div> in the HTML file where the squares will be added.
Defining Colors and Number of Squares:


const colors = ['#e74c3c', '#8e44ad', '#3498db', '#e67e22', '#2ecc71']
const SQUARES = 500
colors is an array of five different colors that will be used when a square is hovered over.
SQUARES is set to 500, meaning 500 square div elements will be created.
Creating the Squares and Adding Event Listeners:


for(let i = 0; i < SQUARES; i++) {
    const square = document.createElement('div')
    square.classList.add('square')

    square.addEventListener('mouseover', () => setColor(square))
    square.addEventListener('mouseout', () => removeColor(square))

    container.appendChild(square)
}
A loop runs 500 times, creating div elements dynamically.
Each square is given a class of "square" (which should be styled in CSS).
Event listeners are added:
mouseover: Calls setColor(square), changing the background color and adding a glow effect.
mouseout: Calls removeColor(square), resetting it back to its original state.
Each square is appended to the container, making them appear in the webpage.
Function to Set Color and Glow Effect:


function setColor(element) {
    const color = getRandomColor()
    element.style.background = color
    element.style.boxShadow = `0 0 2px ${color}, 0 0 10px ${color}`
}
getRandomColor() picks a random color from the colors array.
The squareâ€™s background color is changed to the chosen color.
A box-shadow effect is added to give it a glowing look.
Function to Reset the Color:


function removeColor(element) {
    element.style.background = '#1d1d1d'
    element.style.boxShadow = '0 0 2px #000'
}
When the mouse leaves, the squareâ€™s background returns to dark gray (#1d1d1d).
The box-shadow is removed by setting it to a subtle black color.
Function to Get a Random Color:


function getRandomColor() {
    return colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)]
}
Generates a random index between 0 and the last index of the colors array.
Returns a random color from the array.
How It Works:
When you hover over a square, it changes color and glows.
When you move the mouse away, it returns to its original dark state.
500 squares are created inside the container, forming a grid-like pattern (which would be styled with CSS).
This script is commonly used to create a visually appealing hover effect in web projects, such as interactive backgrounds. ðŸš€
